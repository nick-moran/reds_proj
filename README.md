- pitch_regression_by_pitcher.ipynb
        This is the final notebook that I created that does the linear regression task and generates the output probabilites.
- pitch_regression(ideating).ipynb
        This was the notebook that I developed the regression idea in, you can see my thought process of looking at how the model treats residuals, etc
- pitches_vs_time.ipynb
        This was the notebook where I was looking at games as events and trying to examine how pitches change over time. I didn't really get into this as much as I had hoped to
- explore.ipynb
        The initial notebook I looked at pitches in. You can see the correlation tables at the end
